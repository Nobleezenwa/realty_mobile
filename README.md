## 📱 About This Project

**Realty Mobile** is a modern React Native Expo application that is part of the broader **Realty Suite** – a comprehensive ecosystem designed to streamline the real estate experience for buyers, renters, agents, companies and third party service providers.

This mobile app enhances property discovery and rental experiences for prospective real estate clients. It offers an interactive platform where users can:

- 🔍 **Explore Listings**: View detailed property listings, including immersive technologies such as **virtual tours**, **AR/VR walkthroughs**, and high-resolution galleries.
- 💰 **Access Financing Options**: Compare and explore third-party financing solutions including **monthly rent breakdowns**, **mortgage calculators**, and **rent-to-own** options.
- 🌐 **Connect Locally**: Discover nearby **people**, **businesses**, and **home-related services** based on the location of their prospective properties.

> ⚙️ This app is under active development. This README will be updated regularly as the project evolves to reflect new features, integrations, and improvements.
